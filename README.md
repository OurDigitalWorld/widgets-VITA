NOTE - Jan 2018: As fun and functional as the search widgets are, most blog sites and web sites are severely cutting back on permissions to post a coded include in any kind of copy-paste space...
As such, while nothing in the current 2018 v6  release actually breaks the search widget code... we are no longer actively testing changes and updates to ensure it does not get broken in the future ... use at your own risk   ;-)

============

standard widgets for VITA toolkit sites

All agency sites for VITA toolkit users can have a generated customizable search widget for inclusion on a web site, block, wiki, etc with a few lines of code.  Widgets generated by this code will search all of the OurOntario Portal and limit the result set to the specified agency/site.

<b>Sample:</b>
a sample to see  -  the L.M. Montgomery Research Centre - University of Guelph rendition of the search widget.
This widget limits the result set for the L.M. Montgomery Research Centre.
