============

standard widgets for VITA toolkit sites

All agency sites for VITA toolkit users can have a generated customizable search widget for inclusion on a web site, block, wiki, etc with a few lines of code.

A sample to see is the L.M. Montgomery Research Centre - University of Guelph rendition of the search widget - this searches all of the OurOntario Portal and limits the result set for the L.M. Montgomery Research Centre.
