standard widgets for VITA toolkit sites

All agency sites for VITA toolkit users can have a generated customizable search widget for inclusion on a web site, block, wiki, etc with a few lines of code.  Widgets generated by this code will search all of the OurOntario Portal and limit the result set to the specified agency/site.

Sample:
